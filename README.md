## 🧠 About

This isn’t a static résumé page, a skills list, nor a typical “hero + grid” design.

This portfolio treats the browser like a **terminal interface** —  
minimal, intentional, and narrative-driven.

It’s built to show:
- how I think,
- how I approach problems,
- how I design and build systems —  
before it shows what I know.

## 🌌 Philosophy

The core idea behind this portfolio is **presence over noise**:

**Most portfolios say.  
This one – implies.**

Instead of shouting skills, it nudges the visitor to explore, wonder, and interact.  
Every pixel, animation, and layout choice is deliberate — not decorative.

Key principles:
- *Narrative first* — the site unfolds like a story
- *Systems thinking* — interfaces are more than screens
- *Calm confidence* — no gaudy badges, no gimmicks
- *Minimal motion* — purposeful and subtle
